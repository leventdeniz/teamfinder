## Install (development)
* Clone the repository
* From the `create-react-app` README:
```
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 4 on your machine.

We strongly recommend to use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better
disk usage. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to easily
switch Node versions between different projects.
```
* Install project requirements
  * `npm install`
* Run development server
  * `npm start`
  * Development server runs on port 3000
