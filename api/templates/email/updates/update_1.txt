Hi {{ username }},

I'd like to thank you for being one of the first to try out the Dota team finder website. We've been gathering a lot
of useful feedback and I'd like to share some of the new updates we've made to the site:

- Steam sign in has been added
    - Unfortunately, signing in with Steam will create a brand new player profile. If you'd like to have your
      previous profile moved over to your new Steam-enabled profile, just reply to this email and include your
      Steam username.
- Email notifications are sent when important things happen, like if you've been invited to a team or your
  application has been accepted.
- You can manage your email preferences from your settings (including if you'd like to receive updates like this one).

Here are a few planed features still in the pipeline:

- Improved player and team profiles
    - Add interests (casual, competitive, battle cup, etc.) and bios
- Send messages to other players, or send messages within your team
- MMR verification

Thanks again for giving the site a try, and stay tuned for more updates!
